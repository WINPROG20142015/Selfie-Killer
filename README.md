* Game Genre
  - a sort of violent Side-Scrolling, Hack and Slash.


* Game Description
  - There’s nothing wrong with taking a selfie--- not unless you’re
doing it someplace unreasonable and you tend to block other
people’s way just because of your vanity. Well, experience
the sensation of obliterating all the selfie-whores in your way
with our Selfie Killer game! Where timing is the key to getting
to your goals


* Gameplay
 - Controls: A and D keys

  - Press A to avoid D to slash/hit/destroy
 
  - The main character(MC) will continuously walk to the end of
the stage (going right) until he reaches his destination.

  - There will be [1]Sub goals during each stage to gain points for
[2]upgrading weapons and the MC’s stats afterwards.

  - Avoid normal people : Destroy selfie whores.

  - If you hit a normal person or miss a selfie-whore – MC’s [3]
FPS(Speed) and [4]Battery(Health) will decrease .

* Game Features
 3 Stages: Rizal Park / Megamall / Araneta Coliseum



 * Win State: complete rounds w/out your battery going to 0%



  - [1] S.Goals: complete sub tasks to gain more upgrade points (ex:
don’t miss one selfie-whore) and etc.



  - [2] Upgrade System: upgrading MC’s weapons will help with
his weapon’s range – giving him [5]skills at times too. After every stage he
gets upgrade points – depending on his performance.





  - [3] FPS – MC’s performance in dealing with blockades will determine
his FPS. The faster the FPS – more points and better experience



  - [4] Upgrade System – Not only will he have different
weapons, he can also upgrade them as well. But since we are uncertain of
our programming capacity, there can only be 2 upgrades per weapons. (4
weapons at most)



  - [5] Skills – The MC will also gain skills depending on his weapon
and its upgrades. Players must use this carefully though – some may have
AOEs that would harm normal people as well

* A Little Background on the Story
(Tentative)

 - The Main Character’s mother died in an
accident due to a strong, bright flash of
the camera of a person taking a selfie
on a very inappropriate place. He swore
revenge and wrath upon all Selfie-whores
who are not in place – But his madness
just made things worse, leading him to the
idea that he must kill this so-called “Selfie
lord” that he claims on his own.
Join his madness as he massacres and
rages through places in Metro Manila just
